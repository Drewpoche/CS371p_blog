title: Week Seven

**What did you do this past week?**
I got sick this week before test, hoping it's just a cold and not the flu. Also hope it didn't cause me to mess up anywhere on the test (No Johns). Studied for OOP and an algorithms test. Which unfortunately fell on the same day for me. THat was a bit of a pain, hopefully I didn't do too poorly
on either. Though I'm pretty sure the last question on the test didn't go so hot for me. I didn't really have a proper understanding on containers
going in. At least I'll know what to expect for future exams. Wasn't a huge fan of canvas for the exam but hopefully it makes grading easy and quick.


**What's in your way?**
Still sick. Hopefully I'm in good shape for Monday. One more test for this week
need to do a lot of reading and prepare some essay arguments. Other than that it should be a pretty easy week. Post test week for two classes.
Hoping that project three doesn't involve any Travis issues.


**What will you do next week?**
I need to read a lot of Plato. Finish up and look over some Matrices homework. Find a project partner. Brush up on some essay skills.
Hopefully I'll be able to get started and finish project 3 early.

**Tip Of The Week**
When Downing says most of the test is coding, then most of the test is coding.
Pro tip: Don't get sick.

**Shoutout**
Thanks for everyone posting practice problems and cheat sheets on piazza, some of them were really good practice.
