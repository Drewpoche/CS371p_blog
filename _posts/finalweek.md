**Everything OOP**
For any student looking if they want to take this class, I would highly recommend it.
The class is setup as such. Multiple choice quiz that can be quite difficult, but you always learn or remember something from the previous class thanks to them.
Then for the rest of the time we get really engaging lectures from Downing. A lot of times where we implement some c++ function amongst ourselves. He calls on people so be ready, even if you have no idea what's going on
you about to learn. I originally got pretty flustered initially in the call outs. But as the semester went on it gets easier with practice. These callouts I think kind of serve a dual purpose.
You learn the material better and it helps with nerves of answering questions on the spot really good interview practice. And occasionally your classmates get a laugh.
This class has 4-5 projects throughout the year expect to spend about 10-20 hours on each depending on how fast you are. This class pushes good habits onto you by incentivising group work, and teaching version control, testing, and documentation.
Pro Tip if you take this class the original makefile deletes some edits you need to make the documentation show up. Still a little salty about my 5 points.
This class will teach you some really in depth c++ stuff. You get to write/implement a lot of it too.
There is a lot to be learned in this class and was a great experience for me.


**Gripes**
While I greatly enjoyed the class, there are a few things that made the experience slightly worse for me.
Grading is really slow, it can take a long time for grades to be released. Travis-ci and netflix, queues were extremely slow and getting travis-ci to work with caches was an absolute pain. No technical problems after the second project.
Testing on projects felt a little much at times. Sometimes I opted for completely removing a helper method to avoid writing so many test cases.
On the second test I felt really rushed for time and I was unable to complete everything like I wanted on the test.


**Going Forward**
I'm a little worried, I feel like a did terrible on the last exam, my grade is skirting pretty close to the 700 point mark. I'm going to be super
sad if end up falling short because of my poor performance on that test, I feel like I could have definitely answered those better had I been givin some more time to work with.
Either way I really enjoyed this class, and I definitely learned a lot. It has been an interesting experience writing these blogs every week it was a good way to just wind down and take a look of what's in my way and what I've done.

It's been a great semester
