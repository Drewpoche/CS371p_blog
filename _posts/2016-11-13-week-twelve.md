**What did you do this past week?**
Fairly easy week got my test results for linear algebra and algorithms. Pretty happy with the linear algebra score. Didn't do super great on the
algorithms exam. I had a lot of trouble with dynamic programming problems. This past week we covered a lot of stuff to help out with project life.
Project life is going fairly well so far. I like the design aspects life and darwin shared. Hoping to get done a little early. Been scoring a lot better
on quizzes recently so that's pretty neat. Not sure if I'm understanding this material better or if the quizzes are just a little easier. 

**What's in your way?**
This week math homework returns and project life needs to get finished. And I need to make a note for myself not to forget to do my blog. Hopefully having one entry a day late
isn't too inconvenient. Other than that I need to start prepping for my finals. OOP is probably going to be the hardest I've heard from other students that the final
can be pretty tough and I had trouble with the first test.
 
**What will you do next week?**
Finish projecct life and get a start on studying for finals. Need to go relearn some printstream stuff to get the life class to work.
Finish up algo and linear algebra homework. Looking forward to no more projects and thanksgiving break.

**Sad thing of the week**
My usual Voip program has its servers getting shut down on December 5th.
