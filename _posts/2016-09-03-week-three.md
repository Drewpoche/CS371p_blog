title: Week Three
---


**What did you do this past week?**
Spent way too much time dealing with all sorts of technical issues in getting project one submitted. Travis-CI decided to stop working...
shout out to Taylor Kline and anyone else who helped get a working .yml for people to use. Went into some pointer and reference stuff in cpp. 
And got a refresher on the sizes of each data type.


**What's in your way?**
Trafic... going past the University on game days is actually insane. Project 2 is coming up and I need to look for a partner. 
Math is going to be a super pain this semester. Algorithms and linear algebra are not looking to be low time commitment classes unfortunately.
More readings and math HW need some TLC, spent most of the past week yelling at docker and Travis-CI.


**What will you do next week?**
Cross my fingers for project 1 grade. The rubric felt a little ambiguous at times. I'm not quite sure how well my code is going to perform.
Finish math hw and catch up on some stuff I missed from going to talk to a company. I still need to clarify some stuff for myself,
involving references and pointers in cpp. Not feeling super confident right now in my ability score well if another question of that type apears.
Finish up OOP readings. Looks like a fairly easy week if algorithm homework doesn't prove too tricky.


**Tip of the Week**
Try to finish projects early so Travis-CI doesn't have time to break the day before. A little too much stress there.
