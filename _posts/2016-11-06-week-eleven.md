**What did you do this past week?**
This past week was quite busy for me. I did a ton of studying for a linear algebra test. Fell a little short on the True/False choice portion and turned
a 90 into an 80, slightly unfortunate. Also had to study for and take an algorithms exam. Don't have the results yet. Darwin project took up the remainder
of last weeks activities. It was a really interesting project that reminded me of software design with Batory. Most of the project was us 
coming up with our design instead of jumping in and coding something till it worked. One gripe I have with this project is the ridiculous number of test cases.
Most of them seemed rather superfluous. I feel like testing against 1000 generations and having the correct answer pop out would show that our add creature method works etc...

**What's in your way?**
This coming week the only thing I have to do is readings for OOP and start on the last OOP project life. So a pretty free week coming up, not even
a math homework to do.

**What will you do next week?**
Find a partner for the last project in here and get started. It will be nice to be done with projects. Since I have a lot of time this week,
I think I might start studying for physics. I plan on trying to test out of my first physics course in January. I haven't done any physics
since high school except for some heat stuff in chemistry. Hoping the test won't be too insane.


**Question Of The Week**
If anyone has taken the place ment exam for physics here mind sharing any good study resources or telling me what I can expect?
