**What did you do this past week?**
Finished up project Life. It ended up being a little tricky getting cell to work properly. But we managed to get it done on the last day.
Other than Project life I didn't do much studying, putting it off till thanksgiving. Just a fairly straightforward algo assignment and my weekly quest linear algebra homework.
Winter showed up this is like the first week to have sub 50 temperatures it seems like.

**What's in your way?**
My tests are going to be super difficult I have three coming up the Thursday after Thanksgiving hopefully I can get one of them moved. I'm pretty worried about this classes exam.
From what I've heard It's even more difficult than the first exam. And I had trouble with that one. Hopefully we can get some clarity monday on what to expect

**What will you do next week?**
I'm going to enjoy a great thanksgiving. My folks are hosting this year, so I don't have to go far. And get started on studying for three exams the following week.
It's a little unfortunate because only one of my classes has a final during finals week. So I have to stay an extra two weeks for only one exam.
So that means this last week before break is going to be a little hellish in the test week. Hopefully I can finish strong and start heading towards my last year of school.

**Tip of the week**
Make sure to drive safe this holiday season.
