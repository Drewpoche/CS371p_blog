**What did you do this past week?**
Finally got another 5/5 on a quiz, Woo! We went into c++ pointers and arrays and the slight differences when passing them to a method.
We got project 3 released to us and learned a bit about the c++ allcator. Got netflix grades back and I'm really happy with the score. The project so far has proven to be a little trickier than I initially thought.
I took my classical quest for justice test over the republic and got into a little thought experiment of my own, with a few friends. Does an advanced enough
artificial intelligence deserve rights? And if so at what intelligence level does it deserve them?

**What's in your way?**
Matrices homework has become my least favorite part of the week, I'm slightly behind on some of its basic foundations and I need to go strengthen
those before doing the homework offers me any meaningful understanding. Still waiting on Algo test results, a little nervous about those types
of tests. Project 3 needs to get completed by thursday, so that's on the plate. Hopefully Travis-CI behaves.


**What will you do next week?**
Finish project 3, finish any readings for OOP, start Thucydides/aquire required translation, finish homework for linear algebra and algorithms. Start studying for my next exams.
Then go to my cousin's wedding.

**Tip Of The Week**
Starting projects early, has been the real lesson of this course. You never know when something is going to break and require a rework.
