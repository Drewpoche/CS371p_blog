**What did you do this past week?**
Got to enjoy having no project to do, just been living under the cloud of two tests coming up on Thursday. Studied a little bit, still
have a ton of work to put in for this class. Went over Range Iterators in class and some finer unintuitive points of c++. I have a strong feeling that
the dropped quiz will show up in some way or another on the test.



**What's in your way?**
Tests mostly for this week. One in this class and algorithms. Need to get a bunch of practice in before the test. I need to go back and look through all the
old quizzes. Algortithms is giving me some stress, I always feel very hit or miss on tests like that, hopefully it works out fine. More linear algebra homework
on top of studying.


**What will you do next week?**
Review heavily for this course, I'm betting the test will be a fair assessment which means hard, without the proper time put in. Looking 
forward to getting my netflix grade back. Hopefully it can make back some of the points I lost for my Uva file not working. Finish homework 
review everything from this class, and learn everything I need to for algorithms.

**Complaint of the Week**
Trying a windows laptop for the first time. I swear this thing ignores the settings you give it. Tell it not to auto adjust volume between windows,
still does. I turn off the track pad, it eventually just turns on again.
