## Header 2 Week One##

### Header 3 What did you do this past week?###
Started CS371p with Downing, I've been enjoying the code snippet lecture style he uses. It seems to cut down on the amount of note taking in class
and increase participation.
This first week included an introduction to C++ with a Hello World example. Showing off some of the differences and similarities
with Java. We went into some of the details regarding functions vs methods. Took our first quiz it seemed to be just a way to enforce
high attendance rates, fairly straightforward (if you went to class).

#### Header 4 What's in your way?####
Current problems involve setting up this blog and my Docker VM workspace. I haven't used Docker yet but it seems like the steps to setup 
are relatively few since he gives us some setup tools. I'm also very new to github, this is my first time setting up my own
projects on it. Learning a new language is also on the plate, but supposedly C++ is fairly similar to Java. So hopefully that won't be a hug
problem.

##### Header 5 What will you do next week?#####
Start with finishing up the required readings and setting up my VM, I'm a little disappointed to not be able to use the lab machines.
Take a look at some C++ resources and hopefully bring me up to speed. Take a look at project one and try to juggle all my readings 
from this class and my Classical Quest for Justice class. Looking forward to reading Thucydides again. It's not the type of book
a quick read will suffice on.

###### Header 6 Tip of the Week ######
Meet more people so you have enough project partners!
