**What did you do this past week?**
Began pair programming on Netflix solution. We have most of the stuff ready for us to actually start reducing our RMSE.
Missed a few readings for classical quest for justice. Finished algoritm and linear algebra homework. Went home for the weekend,
got to see my family and dog.

**What's in your way?**
Finishing Netflix. I'd like to get it finished Monday, that would give me some much needed time to study for a linear algebra test on thursday.
Career fair, unfortunately I can olny make the tale end of it since my classes run a little late. Looking to meet some cool companies and
hopefully find some work this summer. Linear Algebra test probably my biggest problem for this week. Two math classes is turning out to be a bit of a
pain, hopefully I won't run into the situation again.

**What will you do next week?**
Get some major stuff done. Finish Netflix project, perfect resume for Tuesday's career fair. Study and ace linear algebra test.
Need to review a lot of this classes stuff we went over Friday. It seemed pretty complicated and my retention isn't super hot on Fridays...
And then catch up on all of my readings.

**Tip of the Week**
If pair programming is allowed do it! In this class it actually gives you bonus points. Two people workking together can
almost always come up with better solutions quicker. Easier, better, faster and bonus points. That's basically the definition of value.
